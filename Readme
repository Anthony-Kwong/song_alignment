Repository for song alignment project. 

Aim: Align song sequences from a captive population of Java Sparrows. The tool will be applied to compare changes in 
song characteristics when certain notes change. 

explore.R: Generates heatmap of note usage for every bird. 

alignment.R : First attempt at drawing alignments. Script turns every song into a sequence of notes. Output a table
with the recording, bird ID, clutch, note sequence, recording number and recording date. Also produces a heatmap for 
proportional note usage for every bird. 

edit_distances.R : First attempt at computing edit distances between note sequences. 

noteSequences.R : Script to turn songs into a sequence of notes. (Duplicate of a part of alignment.R)
