Repository for song alignment project. 

Aim: Align song sequences from a captive population of Java Sparrows. The tool will be applied to compare changes in 
song characteristics when certain notes change. 

explore.R: Generates heatmap of note usage for every bird. 

alignment.R : First attempt at drawing alignments. Script turns every song into a sequence of notes. Output a table with the recording, bird ID, clutch, note sequence, recording number and recording date. Also produces a heatmap for proportional note usage for every bird. Output NoteSequences.csv and NoteNames.csv.

edit_distances.R : First attempt at computing edit distances between note sequences. 

gibbs_align.R : Implement Gibb's aligner.

line_align.R : Align songs from the same line, generate fasta files and plot the alignment

noteSequences.R : Script to turn songs into a sequence of notes. (Duplicate of a part of alignment.R)

note_processing.R : Take every note and generate its own single wav file and spectrogram.

song2plot.R : Align individual birds, generate fasta and plot. 

seq_evo.R : First attempt at modelling sequence evolution using the PHMM results.
