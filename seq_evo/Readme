LikeTransmissionMat.R : Use the likelihood method for inferring the transmission matrix T. 

margin.R : Solve OT problem using the marginal distributions of time and frequency. Used to investigate the weighting between time and frequency. 

mat_setup.R : Create the father/son matrices for the seq. evolution problem. 

note_durations.R : Get note duration statistics.
